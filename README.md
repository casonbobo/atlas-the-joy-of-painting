## Project Overview

The project aims to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data related to "The Joy of Painting" episodes. The data is spread across multiple files and formats, and our goal is to clean and organize this data into a usable format for building an API.

### Resources

- [Bob Ross Paint Color Details CSV](link/to/color/details/csv)

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves consolidating and structuring the episode data and color details data into a format suitable for database storage and API access. The steps may include:
- Data parsing and exploration
- Handling missing or inconsistent data
- Data transformation and normalization
- Database schema design

## API Development

The API development phase focuses on building a RESTful API that allows users to query and filter "The Joy of Painting" episodes based on criteria such as month of original broadcast, subject matter, and color palette. Key tasks include:
- Setting up API endpoints for episode retrieval
- Implementing filtering options (e.g., by month, subject, color)
- Designing response formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
- Implementing authentication and authorization if required
